Harkness's Standard Latin Grammar represents the best classifica-

’ tion and arrangement oi the facts oi the language. It is a Grammar oi

the Latin language, based upon the facts oi that language, not on
“comparative grammar ”; but the facts and laws oi the language are
all presented in the light oi the latest and best grammatical studies,
including comparative grammar.

The principles and laets are presented in clear and simple language.
The work has been pronounced “a model lor perspicuity ol statement
and cleamess oi arrangement.'' It is characterized by strict accuracy
oi statement.

It is very much more comprehensive than any oi its competitors. It
practically embraces three works in one:

It is pre-eminentlya grammar for schools. The part intended to
be learned is printed in large type and is kept distinct from other parts
of the work. It is made as brief, clear, and simple as possible.

It is a iuli and trustworthy grammar lor the advanced student. It
accordingly contains a large amount oi valuable information intended for
reference, and presented in the most convenient form for that purpose.

It is a practical introduction to philological study based upon the
Latin. This part oi the work is kept distinct by being placed in foot-
notes. Abundant references are >made to the latest and bost authorities
on the numerous linguistic questions which now interest the classical
scholar.
