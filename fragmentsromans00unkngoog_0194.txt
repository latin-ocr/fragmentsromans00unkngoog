This Grammar not only presents the latest and best results of Greek
studies, but also treats the language in the light received from compar-
ative philology. Its comprehensive treatment ol the principles and
forms oi the Greek language, together with its clear, analytic method,
has made it at once an‘authoritative and exhaustive treatise lor reference,
and at the same time a practical and popular text-book for class use.
The fact that during all these years it has held its place 'and maintained
its widespread popularity and extensive use in the leading classical
schools and colleges of the country, without change or revision, isin
itself sufficient evidence of the excellence of the original work.

Professor Hadley's Greek Grammar was published in 1860, and was
founded on the scholarly and exhaustive Griechische Schulgrammatik of
the eminent German scholar and professor, Georg Curtius, of the Uni-
versity of Kiel.

Professor Allen brought to the work of revision the enthusiasm and
critical method of an accomplished scholar, combined with the experience
aud skill of a successful teacher, and the result of his labors is gratifying
alilre to the publishers and friends ol the Grammar.

The favor with which the revised edition has been received attests
the thoroughness and discretion that characterize the revision.

In its present form it is a practical work for beginners. Clearness
of statement, accuracy of definition, and judicious arrangement recom-
mend it lor elementary classes; yet at ,the same time it is a complete and
comprehensive manual for the advanced student.

Among the chief changes made in the revision are the following:
The extension of the parts on moods and tenses; versification and word -
formation; the marking of the quantity of the doubtful vowels, and the
statement of the source ol all Greek examples given in the Syntax.
