This work is designed as a text-book for the use of

an account of this branch ol archaeological study ior

equipment of a teacher of the classics, and that the sub·
ject itself has become so important as to justify its intro-
duction, in elementary form at least, into the curriculum
of undergraduate studies. ’ .

A distinctive feature of the book is the number and
character of its illustrations—there being over seven
hundred cuts and diagrams of inscriptions, lor the purpose
of illustrating the text, and for practice in reading. Ol

showing the forms of the letters and the arrangement of
the inscriptions. The work is also supplied with an
exhaustive bibliography and valuable tables of abbrevia·
tions, archaisms, etc.
