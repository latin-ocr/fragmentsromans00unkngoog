¹ Tms book is printed especially for the convenience ol
those college instructors who offer courses of lectures=
and readings in the historical development of Roman
Satire. Excellent editions of Horace, Persius and Juve-
nalare ready at hand, and it is to these authors that the

’ attention of students will doubtless be chiefly directed.

But> it is hoped that the survey of th'e rest of the field of
Roman Satire, though in the more cursory way ol sup-
plementary reading, may be helped by the publication of
an easily accessible and inexpensive text of the more
available portions of the work of the authors here in-

. eluded. The selections have been made primarily lor the

purposes ot' literary rather than of linguistic or of anti-

· quarian study, and the application of this principle has led

to the exclusion of many fragments that are interesting
from other points of view, and to the omission of ex-
tended comment.

As the limited plan of the book precludes prolegomena
and the possibility of textual discussion, it has been judged
, best to print the text of the fragments as established in
certain editions ot accepted value. Accordingly Vahlen’s
